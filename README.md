D2MCE
===========
## Description
Dynamic Distributed Mobile Computing Environment (D2MCE) designed for
mobile device environment. Itâ€™s can dynamic join and leave the distributed computing
architecture and use the distribute share memory to share the availability resources. In
this framework, communication between a mobile devices access the share memory like
the multi-threaded program. We can easily write a network program or a distributed
network parallel computing program. D2MCE is easier than use message passing (ex.
socket) or Message Passing Interface (MPI) to transmit information.
